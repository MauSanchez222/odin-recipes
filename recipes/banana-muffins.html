            <p>Packed with blueberries, bananas, and banana chips, consider Air Fryer Banana Blueberry Muffins your new go-to blueberry muffin. 
                Change them up depending on which berries you have in the freezer, cranberries are so fun for the holidays, while chopped apple is a crowdpleaser in the fall. 
                Baking the muffins in an air fryer is not only better for the environment than heating up your entire oven, it cuts the baking time on the muffins down to a fraction of a normal muffin recipe.

    <h3>Before you begin</h3>
        <hr>
            <p>You're looking for very ripe bananas for these muffins, which means waiting until past the point of speckles when the skin is fully dark. 
                The timing can be frustrating when you're desperate for a batch of blueberry banana muffins, but there is a solution: the freezer! 
                Overripe bananas freeze very well, so it's worth keeping a batch of overripe ones in the freezer for when you're ready to bake. 
                Simply defrost, then squeeze the banana into a measuring cup to mash, then proceed with the recipe.
