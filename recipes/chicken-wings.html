            <p>Fried chicken wings are delicious, but they make a big mess. These air fryer wings are super easy, and they're just as crunchy as the deep-fried kind.
            We're hooked! 
            </p>
            <p>This recipe is a great base for all kinds of wings. Of course, you can keep it classic with buffalo sauce, a side of blue cheese dressing, 
            and some crunchy veggies.

    <h3>Before you begin</h3>
        <hr>
            <p>Here's some pro tips on the house. For the crispiest possible wings, pat your chicken completely dry with paper towels before seasoning. 
                Even better, let your wings chill uncovered in the refrigerator for an hour or two before seasoning. 
                A hearty sprinkle of kosher salt ensures the chicken is flavorful from the surface to the bone.
