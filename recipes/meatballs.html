            <p>For crispy-on-the-outside, tender-on-the-inside meatballs, turn to the air fryer. It will replicate the crust you get when you pan fry—without any oil. 
                Another bonus: You aren't required to stand near a splattering stove to turn the meatballs every couple of minutes. 
                The air fryer does the work for you and gets all sides perfectly "seared". These are stuffed with mozzarella for an extra-fun surprise.

            <p> These can be made ahead and frozen for later use. After step 2, place the baking sheet in the freezer for 4 hours. 
                Transfer meatballs to a freezer-safe container. 
                Cook time will need to be increased to 15 minutes: cook for 12 minutes, shake, and then cook for 3 minutes more.
